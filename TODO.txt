Planned or possible future developments for mrcfile.py
======================================================

* File validation according to MRC2014 standard
  - correct MAP id string?
  - valid machine stamp?
  - correct file size?
  - valid mode number?
  - axis sizes sensible and match spacegroup?
  - axis swap numbers are valid?
  - cell size and angles are reasonable?
  - header statistics are correct?
  - nlabl matches number of labels?
  - valid format version number?
  - valid extended header size for given exttyp?

* Fixing of invalid files

* Handling of different extended header types

* Handling of different MRC format versions

* Data axis swapping (would need clarity about whether header fields such as
  cell size and dimensions apply to axes before or after swapping)
